p0sixspwn is an untethered jailbreak for iOS 6.1.3-6.1.6 by winocm, iH8sn0w and SquiffyPwn.

It works with all devices that support iOS 6.1.3-6.1.6 and 5.2.1 - 5.3 on Apple TV (2nd generation). On 30 December 2013, a Mac OS X program was released to perform a jailbreak. A Windows program was released on 3 January 2014.
